                        I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
                        The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>

                        I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
                        The master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
                        I was broken from a young age<br>
                        Taking my sulking to the masses<br>
                        Writing my poems for the few<br>
                        That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me<br>
                        Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
                        Taking my message from the veins<br>
                        Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
                        Seeing the beauty through the...<br>

                        You break me down and build me up, believer, believer<br>
                        Pain!<br>
                        Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>

                        Can you imagine what's about to happen?<br>
                        It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons<br>
                        And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'<br>
                        This is what's happenin'<br>

                        I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities<br>
                        I know the passages come with some traffic<br>
                        I start with from the basement, end up in the attic<br>
                        And third thing third<br>
                        Whoever call me out, they simply can't count<br>
                        Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh<br>
                        Is you a believer?<br>
                        I get a unicorn out of a zebra<br>

                        I know the bloomin' don't come without rain<br>
                        I know the losin' don't come without shame<br>
                        I know the beauty don't come without hurt<br>
                        Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last<br>
                        I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne<br>
                        I know that losin' don't come without game<br>
                        I know that glory don't come without...<br>

                        Last things last<br>
                        By the grace of fire and flames<br>
                        You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
                        The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
                        But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing<br>
                        Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down<br>
                        It rained down, like...<br>
